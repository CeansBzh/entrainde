# Project Overview

This project is a desktop application that allows users to write down their tasks along the day. It provides a simple interface to add a new task using only a single text input. Previous tasks are stored and suggested when the user is writing, allowing for quick entry of recurring tasks.
The goal of this application is to help users remember what they did during the day without interrupting their workflow.

A future goal is to sync the data to configurable third-party services.
